title: Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program
---

The Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program is Nintendo's way of showing appreciation for consumers who purchased a Nintendo 3DS hand-held system during its first few months of availability.

Basically, "Thank you for spending $250 on a handheld, even though we're going to knock down the price by 80 bucks in a few months". I, of course, was one of the early adopters (I attended a midnight launch).

Only five of the ten NES Virtual Console games have been announced so far. They are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Super Mario Bros.</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Jr.</li>
<li>Balloon Fight</li>
<li>Ice Climber</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda</li>
</ul>

Only five of the ten GBA Virtual Console games have been announced so far. They are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</li>
<li>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</li>
<li>Metroid Fusion</li>
<li>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</li>
<li>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</li>
</ul>

On top of all this, all of the great 3DS games will be coming out in the latter half of this year too. Woop woop! =D
