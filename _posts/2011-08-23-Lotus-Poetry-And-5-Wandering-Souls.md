title: The Lotus Poetry + 5 Wandering Souls

One of my favorite deviantARTists and friends, Raindrop Memory, created this HTML5 game that can be played within your web browser.

The premise is pretty simple: jump around the stage with the SHIFT key and collect five floating heads while avoiding slow-moving blobs and normal-moving tiny blocks.

This is quite a simple game that only has one level at the moment, but I enjoyed playing it. The dude's art style is just lovely, and I am always in awe...I wonder if he'll ever go into animation with short films and such.
