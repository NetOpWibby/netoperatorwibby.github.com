title: Prelude To The Chambered
---

48 hours (as is required by the game-making marathon, "Ludum Dare"), called, "Prelude of the Chambered".

I got stuck on a few parts, and died. That is where I ended my playtime (around 23 minutes...apparently, the game is beatable between 20 and 30 minutes). The only problem is, you have to start the game over when you die.

Prelude of the Chambered reminds me a lot of Wolfenstein, and is even creepier at times.

Java is required to play this game, as it is browser-based. What a marvelous time-waster. You'll look productive while playing this, I know I did.
