title: Mr. Chow

I have heard many a famous person reference Mr. Chow, but I did not know anything about him, other than he operates in the restaurant business. After watching this video, I can understand the appeal of the man. I feel like all the Chinese food I have eaten (thus far) in my life is probably shit compared to everything he and his team makes.

I have got to meet him one day. He sounds like he an interesting guy to conversate with. Oh, and I want his recipes.
