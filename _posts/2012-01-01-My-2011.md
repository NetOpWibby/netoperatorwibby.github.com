title: My 2011
---

It felt so good to see, "2012 | January 01". I have had what felt like an *extremely* long year, with life-changing events a-plenty. But, that is not the point of this post.

I was reading a <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2012/01/01/stock_2011">blog post</a> by the incredible talented Shaun Inman. In it, he listed all of the products he released throughout 2011. Simply put, the guy is a one-man factory of ideas. I was inspired by his blog post, so I decided to do the same:

<strong><a href="http://dsgn.pw-software.com">+ DSGN*</a></strong> Not only did I completely redesign the site (for the umpteenth time), I came up with a fantastic new logo and spent more time on getting things right design-wise, rather than releasing the first thing that comes out of Photoshop.

<strong><a href="http://frsh.pw-software.com">+ FRSH+BTS</a></strong> See above. I also gained a good amount of fans in Japan for the Facebook page of FRSH+BTS.

<strong><a href="http://dsgn.pw-software.com/work/rbfm">+ Rainbow Fragments</a></strong> I set out to design a display font, and I released it after much confusion. Creating a font is not easy (this should be obvious), and I learned a lot during the process. My font was featured on a couple of design websites as well. I found this incredibly flattering for my initial try at something so epic.

<strong><a href="http://thoughtbot.com/">+ New Job</a></strong> I start an apprenticeship on January 3rd at a web design and development company here in Boston. I am going to be taught Ruby On Rails, how to code JavaScript from scratch, and anything else I have been wondering how to do. Which is, pretty much everything. I am very much excited, and I feel like this is an opportunity I have been waiting for since I discovered/realized I wanted to work for myself.

In addition to these things, I have learned how to accept criticism to improve my work via sites like Forrst, I created a business plan for some great things I will release this year, I am collaborating with close friends on a variety of awesome media-related things, my overall skills in general (in regards to music/design/code) have improved significantly, and I found the love of my life.

I am looking forward to writing an even more impressive list January 1st, 2013.
