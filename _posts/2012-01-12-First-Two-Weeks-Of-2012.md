title: The First Two Weeks Of 2012
---

I can honestly say that the first two weeks of this year have been mindblowing thus far, and here's why (techinically, I am still *in* the second week, at the time of this post): my new job as an apprentice at thoughtbot, a web design and development company in Boston, MA.

I just completed one of their workshops to become better acquainted with Ruby On Rails, a fairly comprehensive programming language the company uses on a daily basis. Furthermore, I am reading up on my own, while simultaneously working on other things...such as this here site, for example.

If you look down to the footer, you will see that this site is actually a repository on github, created by myself, using a static website generator called "Jekyll". However, countless issues with Jekyll makes it seem more like Hyde. The irony isn't lost on me. Luckily, I had the foresight to try using my Windows-based PC, instead of the company's MacBook to see if I could get it to work. Obviously, I haven't had any problems on my machine, thus far. The initial downside however, was figuring out how to get git up and running on my machine. Due to all of the experience I have had with coding and such on the MacBook, it wasn't such a big issue.

All of the posts preceding this one were imported from my other blog, PW Software. I may end up replacing that with this one though. I find Jekyll much more intuitive and less of a hassle (hah, *now* I do) than stacey app (PW Software's current blogging "engine").

I suppose I could use Super Robot Karate School as my repository for things learned at thoughtbot. I certainly have a plethora of notes thus far.

This post is getting pretty long, and I feel like tweaking some more stuff. I shall end on a friggin' awesome note:
